# Jamf Pro Cloud - Terraform Exporter Helper Script

A Python script to extract configurations from Jamf Pro and generate Terraform import blocks for infrastructure as code workflows.

## What This Does

This script connects to your Jamf Pro instance, fetches all configurations, and generates Terraform import blocks. Simple as that.

This is still WIP, use with caution!
